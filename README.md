# Framework Bonanza

This project is to test out multiple frontend frameworks and see which one I prefer.

To test them, I'll make the same project for each of them, which will be a simplified pokedex.

For that, I want to do the following things in each framwork

- make a component
  - communicate between components
- make a form
- make an API connection

Beside these requirements, I'll also add Tailwind to all the projects to make it a bit easier for myself visually.

## VueJS review
*This will be a biased review of VueJS since I have the most experience with it

### Pro's
- Quick to set up
- Easy to read syntax
- Easy to configure
- VueJS plugin shows more in dept info about the components

### Con's
- Documentation on VueJS is a mix of V2 and V3 if you just do a quick google search. A lot of help can also vary between versions and as a result can be confusing
- Support is getting better, but it can still fall behind with the more obscure problems
