# Framework Bonanza

This project is to test out multiple frontend frameworks and see which one I prefer.

To test them, I'll make the same project for each of them, which will be a simplified pokedex.

For that, I want to do the following things in each framwork

- make a component
- make a form
- make an API connection

Beside these requirements, I'll also add Tailwind to all the projects to make it a bit easier for myself visually.
